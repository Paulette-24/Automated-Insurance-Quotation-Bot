**REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR**

 <u> **TO THE MEMBERS OF FEKAN HOWELL & ASSOCIATES** </u>

**Report on the financial statements**

We have audited the accompanying financial statements FEKAN Howell, set out on pages 6 to 17, which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31st December 2022, income statement, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.

**Opinion**

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of financial affairs of the firm as at 31st December 2022 and of its income and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the law.

**Basis for Opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing ("ISA"). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the firm in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code), together with other ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Kenya. We have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. The IESBA Code is consistent with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountant’s Board of Ethics for Professional Accountants (parts A and B).

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Key Audit Matters**

Key audit matters are hose matters that in our professional judgment were of significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

**Other Information**

The Partners are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the partner's report, statement and other statements included within the annual report but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

**Responsibilities of management for the Financial Statements**

The management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the law, and for such internal controls as the partners determine are necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the partners are responsible for assessing the firm’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the partner either intend to liquidate the firm or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the firm’s financial reporting process.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISA’s will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise form fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Partners.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of the Partners’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Firm’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Firm to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entity or business activities within the Firm to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are responsible for the
direction, supervision and performance of the Firm’s audit. We remain responsible for our audit opinion.

**Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements**

As required by the law, we report to you, based on our audit, that:

1. We have obtained all the information and explanations (except as provided in the paragraphs above) which to the best of our knowledge and belief were necessary for the purposes of our audit.
2. In our opinion proper books of accounts have been kept by the Firm, so far as it appears from the examination of those books except for the key audit matters mentioned.
3. The Firm’s statement of financial position and income statement are in agreement with the books of account.

*The engagement partner responsible for the audit resulting in this independent auditors’ report is CPA Joseph Kibebe Njoroge - P/No 2798.*

Annual report and financial statements

For the year ended 31 December 2022

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

**a) Basis of preparation**

The financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

**b) Revenue recognition**

Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and/or performance of services, in the ordinary course of business and is stated net of Value Added Tax (VAT), rebates and discounts.

The partnership recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and when the specific criteria have been met for each
of the partnership's activities as described below. The amount of revenue is not considered to be reliably measured until all contingencies relating to the sale have been resolved. The partnership bases its estimat
on historical results, taking into consideration the type of customer, type of transaction and specifics of each arrangement.

Sales of goods and services are recognised upon delivery of products and customer acceptance.

**c) Property and equipment**

All equipment is initially recorded at cost and thereafter stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost comprises expenditure initially incurred to bring the asset to its location and condition ready for its intended use.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the
partnership and the cost can be reliably measured. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognis.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial year in which they are incurred.

Depreciation on other assets is calculated on straight line basis to write down the cost of each asset to its residual value over its estimated useful life using the following annual rates:

Equipment 12.5%
Computers 30.0%
Furniture and fitting 12.5%

The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.

An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.

Gains and losses on disposal of equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are taken into account in determining operating profit.

For the year ended 31 December 2022

**SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**d) Translation of foreign currencies**

Transactions in foreign currencies during the year are converted into Kenyan Shillings (functional currency) at rates ruling at the transaction dates. Assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date which
are expressed in foreign currencies are translated into Kenya Shillings at rates ruling at that date. The resulting differences from conversion and translation are dealt with in the income statement in the year
in which they arise.

**e) Financial assets**

The partnership's financial assets which includes guarantees, cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables fall into the following category:

- Loans and receivables: financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Such assets are classified as current assets where maturities are within 12 months
of the balance sheet date. All assets with maturities greater than 12months after the balance sheet date are classified as non-current assets. Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate method. Changes in the carrying amount are recognised in the income statement.

Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date i.e. the date on which the partnership commits to purchase or sell the assets. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to
receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the partnership has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

A financial asset is impaired if its carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. The amount of the impairment loss for assets carried at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between
the assets carrying amount and the present values of expected future cash flows, discounted at the financial instrument's effective interest rate.Impairment losses are taken into account for determining operating profit

**f) Financial liabilities**

Financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

Borrowings are classified as financial liabilities.

**g) Retirement benefit obligations**

The partnership and its employees contribute to the National Social Security Fund (NSSF), a statutory define contribution scheme registered under NSSF Act. The partnership's contributions to the defined contribution scheme are charged to the statement of comprehensive income in the year to which they relate.

**h) Accounting for leases**

Leases of assets under which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are effectively retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are
charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.

**i) Inventories**
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined by the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method. Net realisable value is the estimate of the selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the costs of completion and selling expenses.

**j) Trade receivables**

Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.

Impairment of trade receivables is recognised in the income statement under administrative expenses when there is objective evidence that the partnership will not be able to collect all amounts due per the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default in payments are considered indicators that
the trade receivable is impaired. The impairment provision is based on the difference between the carrying amount and the present fair value of the expected cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate.

Receivables not collectible are written off against the impairment provision. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the income statement under administrative expenses in the year of their recovery.

**k) Cash and cash equivalents**

For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and financial assets with maturities of less than 3 months, net of bank overdrafts
and money market lines.

In the balance sheet, bank overdrafts are included within borrowings in current liabilities.

**l) Trade payables**

Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

**m) Taxation**

- Current tax: Current tax is provided on the results for the year, adjusted in accordance with tax legislation.
- Deferred tax: Deferred tax is provided using the liability method for all temporary timing differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes. Currently enacted tax rates are used to determine deferred tax. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which temporary timing differences can be utilised.

**n) Borrowings**

Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred and are subsequently stated at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised as interest expense in the income statement under finance costs.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the partnership has unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**

**13. Risk management objectives and policies(continued)**

**Financial risk management**
None of the financial assets that are fully performing has been renegotiated in the last year.

Exposure to this risk has been quantified in each financial asset note in the financial statements along
with any concentration of risk.

**(b) Liquidity risk**

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet obligations as they fall due. The partnership ensures its inflows and outflows are matched sufficiently to minimise its exposure on liquidity risk.

**14. Capital management**

The partnership's objectives when managing capital are:

- to provide an adequate return to partnership by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk;
- to safeguard the entity's ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for partners and benefits for other stakeholders; and
- to maintain a strong asset base to support the development of business.

The partnership sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. The partnership manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the partnership may adjust the amount of share of profit paid to partners, return capital to partners, sell assets to
reduce debt. Consistently with others in the industry, the partnership monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by capital. Net debt is calculated as total debt (as shown in the balance sheet) less cash and cash equivalents. Capital comprises all components of equity (i.e. capital and retained earnings).

**15. Events after the balance sheet date**

There are no material events after the balance sheet date which require to be disclosed.

**16. Deferred tax**

No provision has been made for deferred tax as there are no material temporary timing differences.

**17. Provision for employee entitlements**

**18. Country of incorporation**

The partnership is registered in Kenya under Registrar of Business Names Act and is domiciled in Kenya.
