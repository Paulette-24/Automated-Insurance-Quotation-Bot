Historical cost comprises expenditure initially incurred to bring the asset to its location and condition ready for its intended use. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the partnership and the cost can be reliably measured. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial year in which they are incurred. Depreciation on other assets is calculated on straight line basis to write down the cost of each asset to its residual value over its estimated useful life using the following annual rates: Equipment 12.5%, Computers 30.0%, Furniture and fitting 12.5%. The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset\u2019s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposal of equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are taken into account in determining operating profit."

All assets with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date are classified as non-current assets. Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Changes in the carrying amount are recognised in the income statement.

Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the partnership has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. A financial asset is impaired if its carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. The amount of the impairment loss for assets carried at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present values of expected future cash flows, discounted at the financial instrument's effective interest rate.
